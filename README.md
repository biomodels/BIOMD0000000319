Abstract:  
We analyze on a model biochemical system the effect of a coupling between two
instability-generating mechanisms. The system considered is that of two
allosteric enzymes coupled in series and activated by their respective
products. In addition to simple periodic oscillations, the system can exhibit
a variety of new modes of dynamic behavior; coexistence between two stable
periodic regimes (birhythmicity), random oscillations (chaos), and coexistence
of a stable periodic regime with a stable steady state (hard excitation) or
with chaos. The relationship between these patterns of temporal self-
organization is analyzed as a function of the control parameters of the model.
Chaos and birhythmicity appear to be rare events in comparison with simple
periodic behavior. We discuss the relevance of these results with respect to
the regularity of most biological rhythms.

The parameters q1 = 50 and q2 = 0.02 are explicitely included as the
stoichiometric coefficients of beta and gamma in the reactions r2 and r3,
respectively. Parameter values and initial conditions [ks=1.99/sec,
alpha(0)=29.19988, beta(0)=188.8, gamma(0)=0.3367] are for the chaotic regime
presented in the upper-curve of Figure 3b.
